# GOTHiC++

GOTHiC++ is a C++ implementation of the Bioconductor R package [GOTHiC](https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.GOTHiC "GOTHiC on Bioconductor")

This is Hi-C analysis software which uses a cumulative binomial test to detect interactions between distal genomic loci that have significantly more reads than expected by chance in Hi-C experiments \[Mifsud *et al*,2017\]. It takes mapped paired NGS reads as input and gives back the list of significant interactions for a given bin size in the genome.

GOTHiC++ is available as a pre-built Singularity image which can be run locally or on a HPC, available from **TBC**.

### Requirements
+ Cmake 3.4
+ C99 and C++17-compatible compiler
+ Boost C++ libraries (for unit testing)
+ tbb
+ SamTools (for Bam to txt conversion)
+ Rscript (for independent hypothesis weighting)
+ IHW BioConductor package (for independent hypothesis weighting)

### Building and Installing

In order to compile GOTHiC++, the authors advise creating a build folder within the root:

```bash
mkdir build && cd $_
```

Compiling GOTHiC++ follows a typical cmake pipeline:

```bash
cmake ..
make
```

it is possible that cmake will not use the correct compilers if you have multiple installed, or if it is not installed in a default location. The correct compiler can be passed to cmake using:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++ ..
```

### Testing

Once compiled, the compilation can be tested using:

```bash
make test
```

### Running Single Sample GOTHiC++

GOTHiC++ does not, currently, readin HiCUP bam/sam files directly. Bam/sam files from HiCUP can be converted to txt files using the hicupToTable.sh script found in the src subdirectory where gothic is built.

```bash
src/hicupToTable.sh <input.bam>
```
Specifying bam/sam files in the config file, will result in gothic automatically converting `<input.bam>` to `<input.bam.txt>` if it does not exist. This file is then loaded by gothic.

```bash
<path/to>/gothic <path/to/gothic.conf>
```

or

```bash
gothic -i <filename> -s <name> -d <filename> [-t #] [-r #] [-o <dir>] [-c (all|trans|cis)]
      [-A (single|comparative)] [-l <filename>] [--verbose] [--no_rem_diag]
```

### Running Comparative GOTHiC++

In order to carry a comparative analysis, Samples must be individually run as described above for single samples, but with the "**Analysis: comparative**" option. This mode causes gothic to carry out the fragment identification, binning and frequency counting before outputing the interactions into a binary file (`<SampleName>.inter.bin`). These files are then used as input for gothicomp.

```bash
<path/to>/gothicomp <path/to/gothicomp.conf>
```
 or 
 
 ```bash
gothicomp -c <filename> -s <filename> -n <name> -d <filename> [-b <filename>] [-t #] [-r #]
        [-o <dir>] [-a #] [-A (bh|ihw)] [-C (all|trans|cis)] [--norandom] [--verbose|--debug]
 ```

- When there is a greater than 10% difference in read count between the samples, GOTHiComp will randomly subset the larger sample to match the size of the smaller sample before calculating the P values. This behaviour can be turned off with `--norandom` on the CLI, or setting `RandomSubset: false` if using a config file. 

### Notes on config files

<ul>
<li>GOTHiC and GOTHiCOMP can carry out analysis using only 
	<ul>
	<li> cis (defined as both on the same chromosome)</li> 
  <li>trans (defined as between chromosomes)</li>
  <li>all</li>
  </ul> 
The config default is to analyse all interactions, but can be changed by altering the "CisTrans" option
</li>

<li>By default, GOTHiC and GOTHiComp will remove diagnals; if this is not required, please uncomment the "#RemoveDiagonals: false" line</li>
</ul>

### Installing Boost

If the Boost C++ libraries are not installed, please find the details at [boost.org][https://www.boost.org/]

### Sourcing Intel TBB

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB.git
cd oneTBB
gmake
```

In order to locate TBB, Cmake utilises a `FindTBB.cmake` from [https://github.com/justusc/FindTBB](https://github.com/justusc/FindTBB).
Please note, it may be necessary to add the `-DTBB_DIR=<path/to>/oneTBB` option to the cmake command.

### Independent Hypothesis Weighting for Comparative Analyses
 
GOTHiC++ carries out Pvalue correction using either Benjamini Hochberg (BH) or Independent Hypothesis Weighting (IHW) \[Ignatiadis *et al*, 2016\], which is specified in the config file. Independent hypothesis weighting utilises the BioConductor IHW package, described from [https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IHW.html](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IHW.html).


**N.B.** By default GOTHiC++ carries out Q value correction via the IHW R Bioconductor package. If IHW identifies only 1 bin, IHW attempts to use BH correction, however IHW does not have access to all the information it needs to accurately calculate BH correction. In this situation GOTHiC++ will revert to it's own BH correction.
